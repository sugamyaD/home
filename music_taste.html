			<h1>I listen to music too much</h1>
			<h2 class="caption">I listen to music alot...and i mean ALOT. My spotify wrpped literally showed that i spent the equivelent of  a whole of 32 days listening to music.</h2>
			<h2 class="caption">
				I would say i have a weird taste in music since i feel like most people my age like pop or hiphop but not me. I mean i don't mind HipHop
				but i lterally only listen to 90s rap legends if i feel like HipHop any given day.

		<!--box that talks about my favorite genres-->
		<div id="fav_genre">
			<h1>Favorite Genre:Pop Punk/Alternative<h1>
			<h2 class="caption">I don't know how i got into Pop Punk and Alt music since literally all my friends are Rap nerds but i guess it just happened.</h2>
			<h2 class="caption">
				The thing i like most about this genre is how open and how free it is, like to any other person it'll probably sound messy and
				loud but this is exactly why i like it. I mentioned how i can only do my homework if i'm lstening to loud punk and this is completely true,
				I just can't focus properly with softer music that i know most people listen to when working.

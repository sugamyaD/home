		<!--box about how i crochet-->
		<div id="crochet">
			<h1>probably really weird for a 14 year old to say but I like crocheting</h1>
			<h2 class="caption">
				I think i first learned how to crochet in grade 4 from my then homeroom teacher, which
				is honestly really weird looking back. I then really didnt even crochet again until this
				past summer where we were all stuck inside. I made a little blanket/throw thing.

		<!--box that has my favorite movies and what type of movies i like-->
		<div id="movie">
			<h1>Onviously i love watching TV and movies</h1>
			<h2 class="caption">
				I mentioned in the random facts page that i really like Horror movies, i really to enjoy
				them way better than pretty much any other genre. I also really like psychological thrillers
				since they sort of mess with your head abit and make you think. My favorite movies of all time
			    have to be Black Swan(2010), Us(2019), and The Shining(1980).
			</h2>
			<!--movie posters of the movies i mentioned-->

			<h1>i mentioned in the musicial taste page how i listen to music quite a bit.</h1>
			<h2 class="caption">
				I think it counts as a hobbie and and if you count it as a hobby than i would say it's
				my favorite hobby. I guess I just don't like quietness.
